Wolff Parkinson White syndrome
Additional conduction pathway: 
1. Normal slow node conduction from SV node.
2. accessory fast fibres between the atria and ventricle.

In which case, ventricles maybe depolarized even before the av node and if av has not reached refractory period, then again depolarization occurs from av node into the atria

Block accessory pathway with IA and III CLASS antiArrhythmic drugs

Don't slow AV conduction, or give digoxin, beta blocker, ccb, adenosin (No AV NODE CONDUCTIVE ACTION DRUGS)
