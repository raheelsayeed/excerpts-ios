Net TRANSPORT
GLUCOSE: 
- NORMAL KIDNEY: ALL FILTERED GLU REABSORBED.
- 80% proceeds back into general circulation.
- 20% reabsorbs.
UNCONTROLLED diabetic: NOT ALL FILTERED GLU IS REABSORBED.
- Some amount excreted. As â„¢ is reached.

INULIN:
- FL IS EXCRETED
- FREELY FILTERED: ALL FL is excreted.
- 80% back into general circulation
- Inulin Clearance = GFR

PROTEIN: no excretion.

SODIUM: Secretion
- FL 20%, RECOVER MOST OF THIS. 
- QUANTITATIVELY REABSORB ALMOST ALL SODIUM.
- only tiny amount excreted (thinnest line).

POTASSIUM Secretion
- REABSORBS MORE IN PT > Secrete in DCT: net reabsorption.
- if High K Diet, or on diuretics: Net Secretion.

PAH Secretion
----
COMPLETE EXCRETED, remaining via PT secretion.
- IF HIGH ConcPlasma, saturated Carriers, 
- Some minute amount NOT excreted.

Creatinine Secretion
- freely filtered.
- ONLY TINY AMOUNT IS SECRETED from PT.
- Cr Clearance > GFR

UREA Secretion
- freely filtered
- FOLLOWS THE WATER. 
- IF anti-diuresis, water reabsorbed, so net reabsorption.
- if diuresis: water excreted ,net secretion.


BICARBONATE
- Freely filtered
- COMPLETELY REABSORB.
- acid urine, no significant Bicarbonate in Urine, 
- freely filtered but completely reabsorbed.
