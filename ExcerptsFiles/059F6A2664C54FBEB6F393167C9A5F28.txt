Triglyceride Synthesis from Fatty Acids
Following FA synthesis, TG production takes place in liver and adipocyte cells. TG from liver is transported and stored in adipocyte.

LIVER: 2 sources of origin
- Glucose----> DHAP (glycolysis)
- DHAP --{Glycerol3Phosphate Dehydrogenase}--> Glycerol 3 phosphate
- FROM GLYCEROL: G3Phosphate by Glycerol Kinase
- G3P---{+3FA CoA}--> TG
- TG with Apoproteins: converted to VLDL and sent to adipocytes via blood. Tthis step is inhibited by Alcohol.

IN ADIPOCYTES: SINGLE ORIGIN (GLYCOLYSIS).
- LPL in Cell Wall cleaves VLDL to reveal 3 FA.
- G3P + 3 FA CoA = TG. Stored inside cell vacuole. G3P is from glycolysis.

Adipocyte cell is anhydrous. Less water content allows more storage of TG.


INSULIN ROLE IN TG SYNTHESIS
- TG SYNTHESIS SOURCE (DHAP FROM GLYCOLYSIS)
- AcetylCoA Carboxylase activation (FA synthesis)
- LPL (genetic level)
