Ventricular septal defect
LV is stronger than RV, so, defect leads to Left to right shunt
Oxygenated blood goes into deoxygenated,
Oxygen saturation step up, and pulmonary trunk step up

Uncorrected leads to pulmonary hypertension, finally RV gets hypertrophied which may reverse the shunt - showing signs of cyanosis. - eisenmenger syndrome.

2nd most common congenital heart defect.
Most common opinion bicuspid aortic valve

Pan systolic or holosystolic murmur
