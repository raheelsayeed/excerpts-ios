Glycogen Metabolism
vignette
Branched: 
Many terminal glucose
Polymer


- Glucose --- Glucose 6 Phosphate --> GLucose 1 Phosphate.

- Glucose-1-P =={UTP---> PPi}===> UDP-Glucose
UDP-Glucse is a glu transporter molecule.
- UDP-Glu =={Glycogen Synthase, BranchingEnzyme}== Glycogen

Glycogen is a polymer, branches have glucose.


Insulin {Liver, Muscle} Mobilizes Glucose into Liver via Glut4
- Stimulates: Glycogen Synthase
- Promotes Glycogen Formation and thus Glucose Consumption
- Glucagon Turns OFF Glycogen Synthase (via Beta Receptor Stimulation



Glycogen =={Glycogen Phosphorylase & Debranching Enz}== Glucose-1-P.
"Phosphorylase" Uses Inorganic Phosphate to cleave sugar bonds.
Other one is "Purine Nucleoside Phosphorylase".



Stimulation of Glycogen Phosphorylase releases Glucose into the tissue.
Glucose Releasers:
1. Glucagon (Liver)
2. Epinephrine (Liver, Muscle)
3. AMP (Muscle)

Insulin Turns OFF Glycogen Phosphorylase: activates Phosphatase that Dephosphorylates the Phosphorylase (Glycogen Phosphorylase)


Now Glucose-1-P ---> Glucose-6-P.

IN LIVER:
Glucose-6-P =={Glucose-6-Phosphatase}== GLUCOSE!
We'r back to glucose in Liver, Liver can thus breakdown glycogen to maintain Blood Glucose Level.

In MUSCLE, HOWEVER,
G6P IS DIVERTED TO GLYCOLYSIS (ATP) PRODUCTION.
G6Phosphatase is NOTTTT in Muscle. Muscle is not involved in maintaining Blood Glucose Level.


Why Is Glycogen…… Glycogen? (Branched, Polymer)
A] Glucose alone is Too osmotic, takes too much space in liver and muscle.
Its branched because:
- More water soluble (easily dissolved in liver, muscle)
- More Terminal Glucose, easy for G6Pase to cleave out Glu in sudden bursts.

Starch= Linear Polymer. (Not water soluble).
Glucose - alpha,1,4 - Glucose - alpha,1,4 - Glucose

Glycogen Storage Diseases:
1. Von Gierke's disease: G6Pase
- Sever Hypoglycemia (contrast to Hers's disease)
- Lactic Acidosis
- Hepatomegaly: G6P accumulates, highly osmotic
- Hyperlipidemia (in response to hypoglycaemia, hormone sensitive lipase breaks down Fatty acids giving rise to TGs)
- Hyperuricemia: Short stature, doll-like facies, protruding abdomen

2. Pompe's Disase: Lysosomal alpha1,4-glucosidase
- Cardiomegaly
- muscle weakness
- death by 2 years.

3. Cori's disease: Glycogen Debranching enzyme defect
- Something wrong with glycogen structure!!!
- A lot of single glucose residue stubs at outer branch
- Hepatomegaly
- Mild Hypoglycemia

4. Andersen's disease (amylo-pectinosis): Branching enzyme defect.
- Expecting No proper glycogen storage.
- Very few branches (peripherally)
- Infantile Hypotonia
- cirrhosis 
- death by 2 years

5. McArdle's disease: Muscle Glycogen Phosphorylase defect
- "M"cArdle = "M"uscle
- ↑Glycogen in "M" only.
- [v] "a child running around playground, complains of muscle weakness, muscle cramping."
Child=> Epinephrine => Muscle => Beta stimulation => Gs Protein Activation=>  Adenyl Cyclase => ↑cAMP => ProteinKinase-A =>Phosphorylates GlycogenPhosphorylase. defect here cannot produce ATP, thus Muscle weakness ensues.

6. Hers's disease: Hepatic Glycogen Phosphorylase defect
- ↑Glycogen in Liver only
- Hepatomegaly BUT NO Sever Hypoglycemia
- Glycogen cannot be converted to G6P.
- But since Gluconeogenesis kicks in, ===> Mild Fasting Hypoglycemia.
[v] Hepatomegaly, BG 4.5 mMolar, Kid.
