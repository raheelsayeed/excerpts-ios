Myocardial infarction complications
- Arrhythmias can cause sudden death
- congestive heart failure.
- cardiogenic shock, inadequate tissue perfusion
- Mural thrombus, on the wall of the heart, could dislodge via usualY AF, it goes into systemic circulation
- fibrinous pericarditis
- Rupture (4-7 days) because I'd weaker granulation tissue.
     Rupture I'd ventricular wall will lead to blood in paricardial sac and lead to cardiac tamponade
      - papillary muscle : mitral insufficiency
      - inter ventricular rupture: left to right shunt
- Ventricular aneurysm (Dilatation of ventricle) granulation tissue is pushed out due to its weakness and cardiac contraction, after a week, scar tissue is formed and it stays out : stasis of blood
