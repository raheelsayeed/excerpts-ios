PNEUMOTHORAX
PATHOLOGY.
SIMPLE: 
aetiology: Blebs in the wall of lung, they rupture.
- inspiratory difficulty.
this rupture creates rupture between the pleural cavity and the outside air, air has access to the plural cavity. 
The pressure in Pleural cavity is much less negative, until it becomes zero, lung looses expanding ability.
Forces the lung to collapse, AIR LEAKS INTO PLEURAL CAVITY, EXPANDS.
- LOOSING THE NEGATIVE IPP.

TENSION PNEUMOTHORAX DEVELOPS IF CONTINUOS AIR LEAK INTO PC PUSHES THE MEDIASTIUM TO THE OTHER SIDE.
