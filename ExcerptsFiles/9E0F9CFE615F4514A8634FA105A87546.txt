Bicarbonate Reabsorption
- NO NET PRODUCTION, ONLY REUSED, EVERYTHING IS REABSORBED.

BASAL cell produces C02, which is split into two by Carbonic Anhydase into H+ and HCO3-, HCO3 pumped into PT fluid (Renal Venous Flow) and H+ is secreted back via Na,H+ (secondary active transport Na gradient) into the lumen. 

This hydrogen icon combines HCO3- to form C02 (by CA) and C02 is diffused out.

So no net New bicarbonate is produced.

if this system collapses, and cannot reabsorb normal FL of HC03-, some of Bicarbonate is lost in Urine, creating TYPE II RENAL TUBULAR ACIDOSIS.
METABOLIC ACIDOSIS BECAUSE OF PROBLEM IN THE KIDNEY.
