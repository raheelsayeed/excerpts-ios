Sympathetic Action Kidneys
Vasoconstriction of Arterioles both afferent and efferent.

- GFR dec
- FF increases: proteins more conc, promotes reabsorption.

- forces promoting reabsorption of PeriTubular capillaries INCREASE

Less fluid is filtered, Causes reabsorption in PT caps, as Efferent Arteriole is also constricted, there is decrease in PTHydrostatic Pressure.

Promotes thus. REABSORPTION

No PmS innervation


Conservation of body fluid..
