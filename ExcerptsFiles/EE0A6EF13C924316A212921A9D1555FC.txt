α₁ Action of +Stimulation
1. Eye: Radial Muscle: Mydriasis without Cycloplegia (M3 Action)
2. Arterioles (Skin & Viscera)
- (↑Ca: Contraction SM) Vasoconstriction
↑TPR, ↑Diastolic Pressure, ↑Afterload
3. Veins: 
Contraction. ↑VR ↑Preload
Starlings: Heart Pumps Hearder: ↑SBP
PP Remains the same, as both SBP & DBP are ↑
4. Bladdr Trigone & SPhincter
Urinary Retention 
5. Male Sex organs VasDeferens: Ejaculation
↓Sexual Function: Patient Compliance problem
6. Liver: ↑Glycogenolysis
7. Kidney: ↓Renin Release
This decrease would further ↓TPR
*think of this decrease in renin action as a safety valve. Already α₁ would ↑ SM Contraction, ↑TPR
If there is accompanied Renin increase, the BP would rise sharply.
