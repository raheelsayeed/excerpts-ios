GRADIENT-TIME SYSTEM (PcT Na REABSORPTION)
- carriers never saturated.
- Low affinity for substrate (cannot reabsorb all sodium in PT, little bit always gets passed.
- High back leak (Back diffusion).
- PT is very leaky to Na, K, Cl and water.

Reabsorbs 2/3rd of Na in PT or 66%.
Main metabolic processes of Kidney : Pumping of Na in the Proximal Tubule.
GFR is the main determinant of the metabolic rate of the kidney.
