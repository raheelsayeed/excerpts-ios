Cholesterol Synthesis and Destination
Sources: Glucose.
Cycle starts from Acetyle CoA

Starts with condensation reactions of
- AcetylCOA to Acetoacetyl CoA
- to hMG coa
- HMGCOA--{HMGCoAReductase}--MalonylCoA
- this enzyme uses two NADPH.
- MalonylCoA--Farnesyl CoA
- Farnesyl to eventually cholesterol

Cholesterol finally is used for 
- Steroid hormones
- Bile acids
- Vitamin D
- cell membrane (major in children)

Bile salts use 7-alpha-hydroxylase to make Bile acids from Cholesterol. Using  Cholestyramine renders Bile acids un recyclable and pushes for kore utilisation of cholesterol to create Bile salts thereby reducing blood chol level.
