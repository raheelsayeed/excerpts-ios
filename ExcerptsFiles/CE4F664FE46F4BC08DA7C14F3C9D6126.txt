LUNG FORCE DURING INSPIRATION
NEGATIVE Pa is essential to for air to enter from conducting  zone into the alveolus. 
- At the end of inspiration, Pa is now Zero.
- Most air flow into alveolus: Mid Inspiration: Greatest pressure gradient. 

ANYTHING THAT INTERFERES WITH FLOW OF GRADIENT AS IT GOES FROM 0 TO -1 DEVELOPS RESTRICTIVE DISEASE.
eg. Fibrosis, Asbestosis, Silicosis, Sarcoidosis. (Osis = Restrictive diseases)

At the end At the end of Expiration, Pa: 0
