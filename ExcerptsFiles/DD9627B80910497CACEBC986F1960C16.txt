Digoxin
Drug choice in acute Congestive heart failure.
And SVT

Beta receptors can rapidly desensitize, and in acute management, this would be a problem.
hrouthpto
DIRECT ACTION
Digoxin competitively inhibits binding of K+ at its Na+ K+ ATPase pump.
Results in high intracellular Na
Decreased sodium, calcium exchange (activity)
Increased Calcium accumulation intracellularly.
Increased contractility Positive ionotropic effect.
Increased actin myosin interaction

Indirect action:
- ANS action
- Inhibits neuronal ATPase pump
- increase sympathetic activity through the beta Recetprs
- results In increases vagal activity.
- Cal triggers the release of neurotransmitter release.

Long t half: hence need loading dose. Called digitalization.
Renal cleared: caution in renal diseases, further increases half life specially in chronic heart failure where the glomerulus is already impaired.

Adverse effects:
1. Anorexia, nausea, GI disturbance
2. Visual halos.
3. Cardiac Arrhythmias

Antidote: fab amtibodies as supportive treatment with electrolytes and lidocain and even phenytoin.

Drug interaction:
1. Diuretics: potassium conc is crucial
2. Mg also important
3. Quinidine, and any drug with pro arrhythmogenic effect
