Nicotinic(Nn) Receptor Blockers
1. Hexamethonium
2. Mecamylamine

Blocks all A.N.S activity

Blocks Most predominent Tone (PANS/SANS)

1. Arterioles: SANS.
Block: Vasodilation, Hypotension

2. Veins: SANS
Block: Dilation. Venous Return, ↓CO

3. Heart: PANS (Pacemaker SA,AV Node)
Block: Tachycardia
Tachycardia is because its TRUE Intrinsic rhythm of heart as theres no SANS activity also.
It's fixed. No ↑ or ↓ 

4. Iris: PANS
Block: Mydriasis

5. Ciliary Muscle: PANS
Block: Cycloplegia


Nn blocking drugs do Not affect/prevent any change in HR that was caused "DIRECTLY BY THE DRUGS"
OTHER HEART RECEPTORS: 
BETA-1:
- In Cardiac Muscle
- (agonists- TACHYCARDIA)

M2 - (agonists- BRADYCARDIA)

Sensing this change, Baroreceptor becomes active, sends signal to CNS center in Medulla. 
But it is again interrupted at the ganglia by Nn-blockers.
SO NO NET EFFECT by Baroreceptor.
Hexamethonium would cancel Baroreceptor-Bradycardia

↓BP detected by Baroreceptors:
- detected by SM: initiates alpha1 (vasoconstriction)
- Vasodilation (Beta2)

This stimulation is inturn blocked by Ganglionic blockers.
