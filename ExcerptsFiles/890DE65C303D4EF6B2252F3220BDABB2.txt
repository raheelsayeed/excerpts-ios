Infant Respiratory distress Syndrome of newborn
- Syn: Hyaline membrane disease (Pink, amorphous).

etio
- premature
- maternal diabetes
- multiple births
- c-section

Loss of surfactant, increase in surface tension, this will damange the capillary endothelial cells, allowing fibrin to leak out and lining the alveolar walls. This blocks gas exchange.


Clinical
- often normal at birth, but within few hours-> increasing respiratory effort tachypnea, nasal flaring, use of accessory muscle and expiratory grunt
- cyanosis

COMPLICATIONS:
- PDA
- NECROTISING ENTEROCOLITIS (PREMATURITY)
- HAEMORRHAGE (EXTRA CEREBRAL HEMORRHAGE AT GERMINAL MATRIX)
