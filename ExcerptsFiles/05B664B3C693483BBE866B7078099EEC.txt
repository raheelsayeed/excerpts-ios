Creatinine Clearance
Creatinine: proportional to muscle mass
Released at fairly constant rate

Increase Muscle mass, more Cr released
Skeletal muscle injury, more Cr released

No cr is reabsorbed, all is filtered, a tiny amount is secreted from PTCap

If GFR inc , more filter of Cr more Cr is excreted, plasma level tends to drop

If GFR dec, filter less Cr and plasma level increases. RISE IN PLASMA Cr is clinical evidence of GFR
