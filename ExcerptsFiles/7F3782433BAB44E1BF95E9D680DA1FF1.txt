Annals of internal medicine: combo Statin therapy better than High intensity Monotherapy

High-intensity statins may be given when LDL is 4.91 mmol/L (millimoles per liter) or greater, which is considered very high, according to the National Cholesterol Education Program. LDL levels less than 2.6 mmol/L are considered optimal.


Previous research has shown that two of the most commonly prescribed statins for intensive monotherapy are atorvastatin (brand name Lipitor) and rosuvastatin (brand name Crestor).

The intensity of statin therapy depends on the dose of medication and which statin is used. For example, 5 milligrams of atorvastatin per day is considered low intensity and 20 to 80 milligrams is considered high intensity.

While statins are generally well-tolerated, some patients experience adverse effects, including muscle pain and damage (myopathy), liver damage, digestive problems, rash or flushing, increased blood sugar or type 2 diabetes and memory loss or confusion.
