Obstructive vs Restrictive Lung disease
Obstructive:
- Increased Resistance to airflow secondary to airway obstruction.
- .FEV-1/FVC (decreased)
- Eg. Asthma, Chronic Bronchitis, Emphysema, Bronchiectasis

Restrictive:
- Decreased Lung volume and Capacity
- FEV-1/FVC (normal or less)
- .TLC & .VC
- Eg. Chest wall disorders (Obesity, Kyphoscoliosis, Polio), Interstitial / Infiltrative diseases (ARDS, Pneumoconiosis, Pulmonary Fibrosis)
