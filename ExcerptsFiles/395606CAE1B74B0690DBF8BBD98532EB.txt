Acetyl CoA Carboxylase
An ABC enzyme, like Pyruvate Carboxylase

Activation
1. insulin
   - At genetic level
   - Dephosphorylates existing enzyme
   - drives glycolysis, produced NADPH (HMP)

2. Citrate (cytoplasm)
   - High carb meal
   - allosterical action

DEACTIVATION:
1. Glucagon (sleep)
 Activates protein kinase C, phosphorylatesth  acetyl CoA.
