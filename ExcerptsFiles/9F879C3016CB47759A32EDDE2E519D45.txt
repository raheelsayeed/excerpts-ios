Development of Kidney
- pronephros, mesonephros, mesonephric duct, meta-nephrogenic mass. Wave of differentiation after which degeneration follows.

- pronephros degenerates completely. Only vestigial part remains

- MesoN in early embryo, differentiates and produces urine (earliest functioning kidney). Tubules empty into MesoNDuct

- Cloaca : caudal end of gut tube
- Membrane separates cloaca and amniotic cavity.

- Early in development, membrane ruptures and urine is dumped into amniotic cavity. Most of amniotic fluid is fetal urine.
