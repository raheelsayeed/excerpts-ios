Fatty Acid Synthesis
In Liver:
1. AcetylCoA --{ACoACarboxylase}--> MalonylCoA

  AcetylCoA Carboxylase is an ABC enzyme. Requires ATP, biotin, CO2.
Other ABC is Pyruvate Carboxylase (Gluconeogenesis)

2. malonylCoa --{FASynthase NADPH}--> Palmitic Acid + CO2
  Palmitate is 16:0 FA.

3. Palmitate is sent to ER a for Elongation and Desaturation.
  Nothing is added Beyond C9, thats why Lio acids are essential as they have bonds beyond C9 positions

4. eventually it forms TG, which is sent out via VLDL into Adipocytes.

(V) alcohol inhibits TG and VLDL combo and causes acumulation of TG in liver, (Fatty liver)
