Gluconeogenesis
[v](in Glycolysis, 3 of the 10 enzymes: irreversible)

Most glucose made by:
1. Liver (most)
2. Kidney (as time goes on)


Glycolysis Irreversible reactions
1. Glucose ---{Glucokinase/Hexokinase}--> G6P
2. Fructose6P ==={PFK-1}===> F1,6BisPHosphate
3. PhosphoEnolPyruvate =={Pyruvate Kinase}==> Pyruvate

All Irreversible Reactions should be substituted in Gluconeogenesis

To Make Glucose, The Carbon comes from
1. Lactate or Pyruvate (3C)
2. Alanine (Most Abundant source, Protein MuscleMass Breakdown=> 20 AA, 18 are glucogenic. Lysine and Lucine are ONLY KETOGENIC
Alanine -----> Pyruvate.
3. DHAP <---{NADH<---->NAD}--->Glycerol-3-Phosphate
	
Pyruvate enters Mito Matrix.
1. Pyruvate Carboxylase (adds a CO₂ uses ATP and Biotin) to produce Oxaloacetate (OAA)
MNEMONIC: ABC Carboxylase.
Highly regulated By AcetylCoA.
↑AcetylCoA --- -NF PDH & Stimulates PCarboxylase
Its saying, stop spending glucose and start creating glucose.
[Obligate Activator] AcetylCoA is the Key to turn on engine. 
(Other example: Urea Cycle)

2. OAA shuttles out of Mito into Cyto. 
- OAA (4C) +GTP ---{PEP Carboxykinase}---> PEP (3C) + CO₂ + GDP
- PEP-Carboxykinase is highly regulated.
- Glucagon & Cortisol (turn ON at genetic Level) stimulate PEP Carboxylase
- Cortisol turns on by activating Zinc Finger receptor
- Glucagon turns on by activating on KREB Transcription Factor
- Takes out CO₂ (Contrast to step2)


(Steps 1, 2 require energy.)
Gluconeogenesis is energy requiring


3. Once PEP is generated: Goes back to tOp by reversible steps.

4. Fructose 1, 6 Bis Phosphate ==={F-6-Phasphatase}== F6P + Pi
F6Phasphatase & PFK-1 will not work together at the same time.
- Everything that Turns of PFK-1 turns On F6Phosphatase.
- ATP activates (From TG mobilisation, Beta Oxidation FA)
- F2,6-P inactivates

Anything DRIVES Glycolysis, Inhibits F6Phasphatase.
Anything Inhibiting Glycolysis, activates F6Phasphatase


Metformin Shuts down Gluconeogenesis.
No Insulin affect, Glucagon, Cortisol turn ON Gluconeogenesis.
Liver shouldn't make glucose (via ↑Glucagon, ↑Cortisol) when theres already enough Blood glucose.
So Metformin shuts it down.
