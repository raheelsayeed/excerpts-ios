Pyruvate Metaboliam
Pyruvate in Mito-------- > AcetylCoA
- Catalysed by Pyruvate Dehydrogenase (PDH)
- PDH takes ↑energy electrons from Pyruvate, puts on NAD to form NADH ------ which goes onto ETC generating 3ATP.
- decarboxylates Pyruvate to release CO2
- AcetylCoA -fb PDH.

PDH
- Highly regulated.
1. AcetylCoA Negatively inhibits PDH
2. PDH requires 5 different Cofactors, Coenzymes
	- thiamine Pyrophosphate (TPP from vit Thiamine b1)
	- Lipoic Acid
	- CoA from Pantothenate
	- FAD(H2) from riboflavin
	- NAD(H) from niacin (some synthesised from Tyrosine)
	- MNEMONIC: Tender Loving Care For Nancy

Vignette: Alcoholics deficient in Thiamine. (Alcohol inhibits Thiamine absorption in mucosa and very little in beverages)

If put on IV Glu solution: Patient dies off lactic acidosis.
Reason: PDH will not work, because alcoholics are diffident in TPP. ↑Pyruvate will leak out from mitochondria meet LDH which will convert it into Lactate. (anaerobic route). 
Lactate spills into blood, ↓pH (Lactic Acidosis).
