Sequence of bone growth
From early fetal development to puberty.

Growth Plate

1- Epiphyseal end : Reserve zone of the growth plate consisting of chondrocytes

2- Proliferating zone: deep to the reserve zone, prolifering chondrocytes form clones and align parallel to the long axis of the bone

3- hypertrophy zone: chondrocytes deeper to proliferating zone undergo hypertrophy and produce Type X Collagen and growth factors
Hypertrophic chondrocytes undergo apoptosis.
