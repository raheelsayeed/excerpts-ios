Renal Threshold
Plasma level of Glu at which where few nephrons become saturated. 

Graph begins the patternof splay:

Its the Load of Glu delieved to those nephrons.

Renal Threshold: (GluPlasmaConc x GFR)

if Inc GFR, load delivered to all nephrons. thus even at low Plasma Conc, nephrons can be saturated. 
The point is, RT depends on GFR.
Eg. in Preg, Inc GFR., Glu will appear in Urine in a lower Plasma Conc.
