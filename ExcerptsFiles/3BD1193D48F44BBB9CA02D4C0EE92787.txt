Posterior Pituitary Hormones and ADH
- Oxytocin
- ADH (essential)


Osmorecep in hypohalamus: detect 1-2% changes and sends signals to Post Pit to send ADH to Kidney tubules.

In pregnancy, Osmorecep get set to further down.
More water is drunk: thats how theres increase in plasma volume.
For pregnant women, 290 is hypertonic.

Inc Osmolarity - Inc ADH, reabsorption of water and Urea

Dec Osm - Dec ADH, reduced wTer reabsorption effectively promoting ADH

ALCOHOL INHIBITS ADH, so more urination and hangover.

Volume receptors are not as detailed. Detect variation of 20%.
- location: atria and carotids
