Miosis vs Mydriasis
How to differentiate between drug types?
1. Only Miosis? Without blurred vision?
Alpha1 Blocker
Because â†“Action of Alpha1 Stimulation, radial muscle relaxation.
Nothing to counter "M"'s Sphincter Contraction.

2. Only Mydriasis? (Dilation)
Alpha Agonist

3. Miosis With Blurred Vision?
Muscurinic Agonist.
Blurred vision is due to Ciliary muscle contraction.

4. Mydriasis with Blurred vision
Muscurinic Antagonist.
Promotes the action of Alpha1: Radial contraction: Mydriasis.




Ciliary Muscle:
- Only PANS.
- Only Muscurinic Receptors
- Accommodation only in PANS.
- Only Muscurinic drugs can affect accommodation, not Adrenergic drugs.

- Agonism: Contraction of Ciliary Muscle, Lens Oval: Near accommodation (far: blurred vision)
- Block: Cannot see near vision (blurry).
- Muscurinic Drug S/E: Blurred Vision (far)
