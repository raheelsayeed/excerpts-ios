α₁ Adrenergic Receptor
Stimulation:
- Mainly Smooth Muscle
- Gq coupled, ↑Ca2+
- Smooth muscle contraction.
- alpha1: vasoconstriction arteries and veins, 
- alpha1: Inc TPR
- intestinal relaxation
- sphincters of GI / Bladder: contraction, retention.
- radial muscle: contraction
- agonists DO NOT CHANGE PP

Mechanism:
α1-Adrenergic receptors are members of the G protein-coupled receptor superfamily. Upon activation, a heterotrimeric G protein, Gq, activates phospholipase C (PLC), which causes an increase in IP3 and calcium. This triggers further effects, primarily through the activation of an enzyme Protein Kinase C. This enzyme, as a kinase, functions by phosphorylation of other enzymes causing their activation, or by phosphorylation of certain channels leading to the increase or decrease of electrolyte transfer in or out of the cell.


Agonist:
- Epinephrine
- Norepinephrine

Blockers
- Prazosin drug
