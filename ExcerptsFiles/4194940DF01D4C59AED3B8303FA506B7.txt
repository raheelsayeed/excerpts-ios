Adrenal Hormones, Stress hormones
STRESS HORMONES
- GLUCAGON
- CORTISOL
- CATECHOLAMINES
- GROWTH HORMONE
- CORTISOL POTENTIATES GLUCAGON AND GROWTH HORMONES

All:
- more glu
- inc lipolysis

- GH formes Protein
- Cortisol dissolves protein
- Glucagon diverts AA to Gluconeogenesis and leaves Urea. Like What ketone is to Fatt metabolism

Cortisol:
- Inc protein degradation, inc delievery of aminoacids
- Inc Lipolysis and delivery of FFA and glycerol
- Raises Blood Glu by
  - inhibiting Glu uptake
  - Liver Gluconeogenesis from aminoacids by potentiating glucagon


V: Undr conditions of stress
Hypothalamus releases CRH
- CRH acts on ant pit to release ACTH
- ACTH acts on Zone Fasciculata to make cortisol
Cortisol raises Glu levels to maintain naurishment in the vital organs
- ant Pit also releases Beta opiate: Endorphins (pain modulator) and Beta-melanocyte stimulating hormone (MSH). Dark skinning!
- inc Cortisol feedback inhibition to Hypothalamus and Pituitary.


macula-dena senses Na concentration releases Renin

juxta-glomerula apparatus senses Hypotension and releases Renin
- renin also stimulated by Beta stimulation
