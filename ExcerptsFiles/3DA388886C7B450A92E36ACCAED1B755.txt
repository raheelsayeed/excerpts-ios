Beta Oxidation of Fatty Acids
basics:
- each cycle : 5 ATP
- kreb (12 atp) not included
- fA-Acyle-CoA-dehydrogenase
- in starvation states
- substrate: FA

FA enters liver into Mitochondria

Inside Membrane space

FA--{CoA, ATP, FattyAcylCoASynthetase}-- FA-CoA

- FA-Coa + Carnitine =={carnitine Acyltransferase1} == FA-Carnitine + CoA

This Cat-1 is regulated by #MalonylCoA (FA synthesis)
High MCoA will inhibit Cat-1 and not immediately burn the newly formed FA.

FA-carnitine is transported across a special carnitine transporter into the Mito matrix and CAt-2 recreates FA-CoA.

- FA-CoA + FAD + NAD {Fatty acid AceylCoA dehydrogenase} == FA-CoA (-2C) + FADH2 + NADH + AcetylCoA.

- FADh2 and Nadh are utilised jn Electron Transport Chain (ETC) to produce 2 and 3 ATP respectively.
- step is repeated until the whole FA carbons are used up.

PATHOLOGY
--------
- Myopathic CAT deficiency
- muscle weakness
- muscle pain
- Myoglobinuria
- dx: biopsy of muscle cells showing triglycerid accumulation (muscle cells cannot form chylomicrons for transport)
- prolonged exercisE
- autosomal recessive
- CONTRAST THIS WITH McArdle's disease, both show history of a playing kid with muscle pain. This shows glycogen in cells

MCAD deficiecy
- Medium chain Acyl Dehydrogenase
- VOMITING, COMA DEATH
- accumulated DICARBOXYLIC ACIDS.
- FASTING HYPOGLYCEMIA (gluconeo)
- HYPOKETOSIS (acetylCoa-ketones)
- c10-8 acyl carnities in blood. 
- DICARBOXYLIC ACIDEMIA is diagnostic, its because the FA left over because of ineffective Beta oxidation is diverted to peroxixomes, where they under go omega-oxidation and form Dicarboxylic acidemia in Urine.

Propionate Metabolism basics
---------------
- ODD-CHAIN FA only utilised.
- The only part of BetaOxidation where FA is used in producing Glu.

- PropionylCoA--{PropionylCoA Carboxylase}-- MethylMelonylCoa
PropionylCoACarboxylase is an ABC carboxylase Enzyme

- MethylMelonylCoA --{mutase}--> SuccinylCoa

- SuccinylCoA --> Krebs Cycle
- SuccinylCoA --> OAA (gluconeo)---> Glu


Pathology:
MethylMalonic Acidemia
-----------
MethylMalonylCoA to SuccinylCoA is done by a Mutase in the presence of B12.
This reaction will not succeed in:
1. B12 deficiency: Megaloblastic anemia
2. Enzyme defect: mutase
3. Intrinsic Factor deficiency: pernicious anemia
4. Active-B12 deficiency
As a result, MethylMalonic acidemia and aciduria happens which differenciates from Folate deficicy

And accumulation of methyl-malonic acid and ODd-FA in neurons overtime causes Progressive Peripheral neuropathy.
