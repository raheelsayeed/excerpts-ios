Fatty Acid Synthesis basics
Requirements:
1. Acetyl CoA (2C)
2. NADPH
3. Co2
4. Atp

Location: cytoplasm

AcetylCoA is sourced from TCA, when enough of TCA is going on, NADH inhibits conversion of citrate to isocitrate.
This accumulated citrate is diverted outside the mitochondria into the cytoplasm and as it becomes the source for gluconeogenesis, also participates in FA synthesis.

Citrate ---> AcetyleCoA + OAA.
OAA becomes Malate and later pyruvate.


So direct. Source is Citrate

NADPH SOURCE:
- HMP
- CCitrate --> OAA--> Malate. 
Malate to pyruvate yeilds NADPH  catalysed by malic enzyme
