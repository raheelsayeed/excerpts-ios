Beta1 receptor
Stimulation:
- CM contraction, inc cAMP. In contrast to alpha2 receptor.
- increase HR, SV
- non intestinal smooth muscle involvement.

Beta receptors are more sensitive than alpha receptors. At low NE doses, beta response is primary, at high doses, alpha response takes over.

Mechanism: Gs coupled activation of Adenyl Cyclase, will increase cAMP in the cytoplasm, which activated Phosphokinase C, causes phosphorylation and forms something.

Selective agonist: Isoprenalin
