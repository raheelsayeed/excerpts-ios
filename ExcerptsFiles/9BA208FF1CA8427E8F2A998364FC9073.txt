DIFFUSION CAPACITY OF LUNG (DLCO)
- Perfusion Limited Situation
substance equates between capillary & Interstitium.
- Diffusion Limited Situation
substance does NOT equilibrate between capillary & interstitum.

SOLUBILITY: CO > CO₂ >> O₂
AFFINITY TO Hb: CO > O₂ > CO₂.
assuming pressure is constant.

Vignette: Not only does CO diffuse first and quickly, it replaces O₂ due to higher affinity.
CO is great to measure the diffusion capacity of the lung as it is most soluble.
PCO in plasma is ZERO, all is bound to Hb as affinity is high.
