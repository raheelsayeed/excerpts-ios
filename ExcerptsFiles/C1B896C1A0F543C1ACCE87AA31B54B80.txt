PNEUMOCONIOSIS
- coal mining
- abuse substance inhalation
- initially: scar tissue secondary to inhalation
- size < 10microns

i. Coworkers Pneomoconiosis
- Anthrocosis: Carbon pigment in macs, along pleural lymphatics and interstitial.
Asymptomatic.

ii. Simple Coal worker's pneumoconiosis
- black lung disease
coal-dust macules and nodules in upper lobes
Little pulmonary dysfunction

iii. Complicated Coal-worker's pneumoconiosis
- Progressive massive fibrosis
- ^RespiratoryDistress
- Secondary Pulmonary HTN, Cor pulmonale

iv. Caplan Syndrome
Pneumoconiosis + Rheumatoid arthritits

v. asbestosis
Shipyard worker, brake lining.
Serpentine: Curved, flexible
- Lower lobe of lung.
-- Complications:
- Bronchogenic carcinoma (Synergy with smoke)
- Malignant Mesothelioma (white blank ate around the lung)
- Poor prognosis
Rule out Mesothelioma in Pleura or Adenocarcinoma of lung (micro villa will be short in Adeno, meso : long)

- family members risk
- caplan syndrome
- 

Silicosis (TB, Upperlobe, sand)
Occupations: Sand blasters. SAND, Beach
associated with TB
- Upper lobe of lung (contrast to asbestosis, Lower lobe)

Berylliosis -Keys
- Aerospace industry
- Nuclear Reactors
- Type IV Hypersensitivity granuloma
