Hormone types
Steroid hormones are "like Chol"
- protein bound
- long half life
- intracellular action
- origin: target Organ hormones

- (steroid) LIPID SOLUBLE hormones are synthesized as needed, dissolved in plasma.

- All Peptide hormones are synthesized and stored in vesicles. Vesicles made of lipids, dissolved free without protein-binding EXCEPT IGF: INSULIN LIKE GROWTH FACTOR

Peptide Hormones
- have cell surface receptor
- peptide hormone attaches to receptor
- receptor activated Gpr
- gpro causes effect inside the cell via a secondary messenger.
  - cAMP
  - Calcium
  - iP-3 (inositol triphos)
  - DAG diacylglycerol
  - insulin has its own mechanism with Tyrosin kinase.

- second messenger phosphorylate or de phosphorylate the protein which are already made
