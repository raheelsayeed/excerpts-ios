Intramembranous Bone formation
Originates directly from primitive mesenchyme to form bone.

Sites: forms flat bones of skull during embryogenesis

Cortical bone on cortical bone on surface of bones

1- During embryogenesis, flat bones begin as collections of condensed mesenchymal cells induced to become osteoblasts

2- as collections grow they fuse into interconnected cords (trabecula) with intervening mesenchyme.

3- forms primary spongy bone and has randomly arranged collagen fibres
