Hormone Actions and Characters
1. Normally Hormones are Rate Limiting factors
- Inc hormones: Inc action
- Receptors are already high!
- Plasma hormone level indicated the degree of activity

2. Downregulagion or Receptor saturation
- too high Hormones: Receptors involute, reduce in sensitivity.
- abnormalities related to distal receptor action are offrn dir to high corculating hormone levels. Like in Type 2 Diabetes!

3. PERMISSIVE ACTION:
- the phenon in which one hormone must be present for another hormone to perform its action.
Eg Cortisol permits Glucagon to promote Gluconeogenesis

4. Plasma analysis
- pulsatile secretion, Diurnal variation, cyclical, age.
- t4: constant
- growth hormone: diurnal, secreted in nights measured in morninh
- testoste : age. (Sex hormones)

5. urine analysis
- Cortisol, sex hormones: When sugar coated, become unbound and get excreted
- useful in Steroid and catecholamines
- difference between pheochromo and panic attacks (urine xatecholamines)
- 24 urine sample cortisol can provide an integrated base value in detecting cushings disease.
