Osteoclasts
Breaks down bone matrix
With release of Ca

Origin: from cells of blood monocyte lineage which ultimately comes from hematopoetic stem cells

During early embryogenesis or bone formation or remodelling, where there is not adjacent bone marrow, osteoclasts are recruited from circulating blood cells and later from adjacent bone marrow
