Autoimport Dropbox Files.
-------------

Use this feature if you want to automate importing ***selected and recently modified*** files from **Dropbox**.  Essentially, you select a destination folder within Dropbox and RENOTE will monitor and import newly edited text files **that have a specific Tag in their filename**, a *tag* that you perhaps specifically (or not) add in the filename with the intent of RENOTE importing it at next app launch.

The Tag does not have to be unique, it is merely an identifier that tells RENOTE to `IMPORT ANY RECENTLY EDITED TEXT FILE(s) IN A PREDETERMINED FOLDER THAT HAVE THE CHARACTERS '@renote' IN ITS FILENAME`. Where **@renote** is my filename tag.

**All auto-imported notes exist  independently from other notes**. Tapping `Save` will cause the file to be saved back again in Dropbox. You should be able to resume editing files using any other text editor.


### How To

1. **Path**: Enter a folder path thats relative and within your Dropbox folder. Example: `/nvALT/`, where **nvALT** is a folder in the base directory of Dropbox. RENOTE will **only** monitor one folder and its files. It will **not** monitor nested directories.
2. **Filename  Tag**: This is a simple keyword that you want to associate with all files that should be imported. Enter any thing like `@renote` or `mypapers`. A keyword that would be unique enough to not be normally within a filenames is a good starting point. The default is `@renote`.
2.  Creating a file in `/nvALT/`, include a **Filename tag**. Example: `Metformin Mechanism of action @renote.txt`; where **`@renote`** is the specified filename tag. This is critical and the only way to tell RENOTE whether or not a file is importable.
4. RENOTE associates filename with the imported note. As such, any change in filename will result in a new imported note being created (if tagged) and render the old one unlinked. RENOTE will assume the files are different.
3. **Finally:** Make sure you Enable Automatic Import to use this feature.


### Key Points to Remember

1. Only text files with a common *tag* are auto importable.
1. Files are assumed to be text files. Any other format is not recognized and ignored.
2. Files must be located in an existing folder within Dropbox, the path to which you specify in the `Path` textfield.
3. Imported Notes are auto-tagged within the app with "**Dropbox AutoImport Files**".
5. Any subsequent changes to the folderpath of the actual files will not be reflected within RENOTE. These imported notes have to be manually dealth with.
5. RENOTE *does* save and store additional data that you might associate with these files, i.e. **Tags** and **Links**. A tag "**Dropbox Files**" is automatically added to each new import of the file. However, this additional metadata is *not* reflected within the file.
6. Deleting such notes in the app will not delete the File itself.
3. A dropbox-imported file, if edited in RENOTE, the changes will be synced to the same file in the specified Dropbox folderpath. Such files are clearly indicated with a 'Dropbox' logo.  In such a case, RENOTE changes and maintains these files without importing its data directly into its database.
6. Lastly ***There is no duplication of data within Dropbox.***
