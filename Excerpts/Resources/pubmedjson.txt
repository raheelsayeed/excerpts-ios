The effects of high glucose on the passage of albumin across the glomerular ESL were analysed in streptozotocin-induced diabetic Sprague-Dawley rats for 4 weeks. Albuminuria and glomerular mesangial matrix were significantly increased in diabetic rats. The passage of albumin across the ESL, as measured by albumin-colloid gold particle density in the glomerular basement membrane (GBM), was increased significantly in diabetic rats. The thickness of the glomerular ESL, examined indirectly by infusing Intralipid into vessels using an electron microscope, was significantly decreased and the GBM exhibited little change in diabetic rats. In summary, the glomerular ESL may play a role in the pathogenesis of albuminuria in rats with early-stage diabetes."},"AuthorList":{"CompleteYN":"Y","Author":[{"ValidYN":"Y","LastName":"Zhang","ForeName":"Chunyang","Initials":"C","Affiliation":"Division of Endocrinology, Shanghai Tongji Hospital Affiliated Tongji University, No. 389, Xincun Road, Shanghai 200065, China."},{"ValidYN":"Y","LastName":"Meng","ForeName":"Yao","Initials":"Y","Affiliation":"Division of Endocrinology, Shanghai Tongji Hospital Affiliated Tongji University, No. 389, Xincun Road, Shanghai 200065, China ; Key Laboratory of Nutrition and Metabolism, Institute for Nutritional Sciences, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 200031, China."},{"ValidYN":"Y","LastName":"Liu","ForeName":"Qi","Initials":"Q","Affiliation":"Division of Endocrinology, Shanghai Tongji Hospital Affiliated Tongji University, No. 389, Xincun Road, Shanghai 200065, China."},{"ValidYN":"Y","LastName":"Xuan","ForeName":"Miao","Initials":"M","Affiliation":"Division of Endocrinology, Shanghai Tongji Hospital Affiliated Tongji University, No. 389, Xincun Road, Shanghai 200065, China."},{"ValidYN":"Y","LastName":"Zhang","ForeName":"Lanyu","Initials":"L","Affiliation":"Department of Endocrinology, Changzheng Hospital, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai 200041, China."},{"ValidYN":"Y","LastName":"Deng","ForeName":"Bo","Initials":"B","Affiliation":"Key Laboratory of Nutrition and Metabolism, Institute for Nutritional Sciences, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 200031, China."},{"ValidYN":"Y","LastName":"Zhang","ForeName":"Keqin","Initials":"K","Affiliation":"Division of Endocrinology, Shanghai Tongji Hospital Affiliated Tongji University, No. 389, Xincun Road, Shanghai 200065, China."},{"ValidYN":"Y","LastName":"Liu","ForeName":"Zhimin","Initials":"Z","Affiliation":"Department of Endocrinology, Changzheng Hospital, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai 200041, China."},{"ValidYN":"Y","LastName":"Lei","ForeName":"Tao","Initials":"T","Affiliation":"Division of Endocrinology, Shanghai Tongji Hospital Affiliated Tongji University, No. 389, Xincun Road, Shanghai 200065, China."}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":"Journal Article"},"ArticleDate":{"DateType":"Electronic","Year":"2014","Month":"04","Day":"09"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"Egypt","MedlineTA":"J Diabetes Res","NlmUniqueID":"101605237"},"CitationSubset":"IM"},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"PubStatus":"received","Year":"2014","Month":"1","Day":"14"},{"PubStatus":"accepted","Year":"2014","Month":"3","Day":"27"},{"PubStatus":"epublish","Year":"2014","Month":"4","Day":"9"},{"PubStatus":"entrez","Year":"2014","Month":"5","Day":"10","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"PubStatus":"pubmed","Year":"2014","Month":"5","Day":"9","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"PubStatus":"medline","Year":"2014","Month":"5","Day":"9","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":[{"IdType":"doi","content":"10.1155\/2014\/953740"},{"IdType":"pubmed","content":"24812636"},{"IdType":"pmc","content":"PMC4000657"}]}},"description":null,"title":null},{"MedlineCitation":{"Owner":"NLM","Status":"PubMed-not-MEDLINE","PMID":{"Version":"1","content":"24812565"},"DateCreated":{"Year":"2014","Month":"05","Day":"09"},"DateCompleted":{"Year":"2014","Month":"05","Day":"09"},"Article":{"PubModel":"Print-Electronic","Journal":{"ISSN":{"IssnType":"Print","content":"1741-427X"},"JournalIssue":{"CitedMedium":"Print","Volume":"2014","PubDate":{"Year":"2014"}},"Title":"Evidence-based complementary and alternative medicine : eCAM","ISOAbbreviation":"Evid Based Complement Alternat Med"},"ArticleTitle":"Protection Effect of Zhen-Wu-Tang on Adriamycin-Induced Nephrotic Syndrome via Inhibiting Oxidative Lesions and Inflammation Damage.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"131604"},"ELocationID":{"EIdType":"doi","ValidYN":"Y","content":"10.1155\/2014\/131604"},"Abstract":{"AbstractText":"Zhen-wu-tang (ZWT), a well-known formula in China, is widely used to treat chronic kidney diseases. However, very little information on ZWT's mechanism of action is currently available. In this study, we investigated the possible protective role and underlying mechanism of ZWT on nephrotic syndrome (NS) induced by Adriamycin (intravenous injection, 6.0\u2009mg\/kg) in rats using biochemical and histopathological approaches. ZWT decreased urine protein excretion and the serum levels of total cholesterol, triglycerides, blood urea nitrogen, and creatinine significantly in diseased rats. A decrease in plasma levels of total protein and albumin was also recorded in nephropathic rats. Pathological results show an improved pathological state and recovering glomerular structure in ZWT treatment groups. ZWT decreased renal IL-8 level but increased renal IL-4 level. In addition, rats subjected to ZWT exhibited less IgG deposition in glomerulus compared with model group. RT-PCR results showed that ZWT decreased the mRNA expression of NF- \u03ba B p65 and increased the mRNA expression of I \u03ba B. Furthermore, ZWT reduced the level of MDA and increased SOD activity. These results demonstrated that ZWT ameliorated Adriamycin-induced NS in rats possibly by inhibiting Adriamycin-induced inflammation damage, enhancing body's antioxidant capacity, thereby protecting glomerulus from injury."},"AuthorList":{"CompleteYN":"Y","Author":[{"ValidYN":"Y","LastName":"Liang","ForeName":"Chun-Ling","Initials":"CL","Affiliation":"School of Chinese Materia Medica, Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine, Guangzhou, Guangdong 510006, China."},{"ValidYN":"Y","LastName":"Wu","ForeName":"Jun-Biao","Initials":"JB","Affiliation":"School of Chinese Materia Medica, Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine, Guangzhou, Guangdong 510006, China."},{"ValidYN":"Y","LastName":"Lai","ForeName":"Jie-Mei","Initials":"JM","Affiliation":"School of Chinese Materia Medica, Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine, Guangzhou, Guangdong 510006, China."},{"ValidYN":"Y","LastName":"Ye","ForeName":"Shu-Fang","Initials":"SF","Affiliation":"School of Chinese Materia Medica, Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine, Guangzhou, Guangdong 510006, China."},{"ValidYN":"Y","LastName":"Lin","ForeName":"Jin","Initials":"J","Affiliation":"School of Chinese Materia Medica, Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine, Guangzhou, Guangdong 510006, China."},{"ValidYN":"Y","LastName":"Ouyang","ForeName":"Hui","Initials":"H","Affiliation":"School of Chinese Materia Medica, Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine, Guangzhou, Guangdong 510006, China."},{"ValidYN":"Y","LastName":"Zhan","ForeName":"Janis Ya-Xian","Initials":"JY","Affiliation":"School of Chinese Materia Medica, Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine, Guangzhou, Guangdong 510006, China."},{"ValidYN":"Y","LastName":"Zhou","ForeName":"Jiu-Yao","Initials":"JY","Affiliation":"School of Chinese Materia Medica, Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine, Guangzhou, Guangdong 510006, China."}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":"Journal Article"},"ArticleDate":{"DateType":"Electronic","Year":"2014","Month":"04","Day":"09"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"United States","MedlineTA":"Evid Based Complement Alternat Med","NlmUniqueID":"101215021","ISSNLinking":"1741-427X"}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"PubStatus":"received","Year":"2014","Month":"1","Day":"5"},{"PubStatus":"revised","Year":"2014","Month":"2","Day":"23"},{"PubStatus":"accepted","Year":"2014","Month":"2","Day":"24"},{"PubStatus":"epublish","Year":"2014","Month":"4","Day":"9"},{"PubStatus":"entrez","Year":"2014","Month":"5","Day":"10","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"PubStatus":"pubmed","Year":"2014","Month":"5","Day":"9","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"PubStatus":"medline","Year":"2014","Month":"5","Day":"9","Hour":"6","Minute":"1"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":[{"IdType":"doi","content":"10.1155\/2014\/131604"},{"IdType":"pubmed","content":"24812565"},{"IdType":"pmc","content":"PMC4000650"}]}},"description":null,"title":null},{"MedlineCitation":{"Owner":"NLM","Status":"Publisher","PMID":{"Version":"1","content":"24812417"},"DateCreated":{"Year":"2014","Month":"5","Day":"9"},"Article":{"PubModel":"Print-Electronic","Journal":{"ISSN":{"IssnType":"Electronic","content":"1600-0455"},"JournalIssue":{"CitedMedium":"Internet","PubDate":{"Year":"2014","Month":"May","Day":"8"}},"Title":"Acta radiologica (Stockholm, Sweden : 1987)","ISOAbbreviation":"Acta Radiol"},"ArticleTitle":"Factors related to thrombosis of gastric varix during balloon-occluded retrograde transvenous obliteration.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":null},"Abstract":{"AbstractText":[{"Label":"BACKGROUND","NlmCategory":"BACKGROUND","content":"Balloon-occluded retrograde transvenous obliteration (B-RTO) has become known as an effective treatment for gastric varices with a gastrorenal shunt.

The 27 studies retrieved comprised in vitro and animal studies. A quality score was developed, giving 1 point for each of the following criteria: six or more experiments, confirmation by more than one experimental approach, neutralization of the biologic effect by counteractive reagents or antibodies, use of a real-life model, and use of dose-response analyses in vitro and\/or animal studies. The overall average score was 3 of 5 points, with five studies scoring 5 of 5 points and six studies scoring 4 of 5 points, highlighting the superior quality of a substantial number of the retrieved studies.

But studies on biocompatibility and the impacts of LA and GA ratio (LA\/GA\u2009=\u200960\/40, 70\/30, and 80\/20) in main material have not yet been reported. Hemolysis experiment indicates that the hemolysis rate of PEAL extraction medium is less than 5%. Whole blood clotting time (CT), plasma recalcification time, activated partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time evaluations, and dynamic CT assay show that the anticoagulant time of PEAL copolymer for blood is longer than that under negative and positive control. Protein adsorption assay indicates that PEAL films adsorb less protein than PLGA films (p\u2009&lt;\u20090.01); but comparing with expanded polytetrafluoroethylene, the aforementioned difference is not significant (p\u2009&gt;\u20090.05). Complement activation test shows that PEAL surface does not induce complement activation. CCK8 measurement shows that the relative growth rates of Huh7, L02, and L929 cells co-incubated with PEAL nanoparticles (NPs) are more than 90%. PEAL NPs co-incubated with 5% foetal bovine serum or 2% bovine serum albumin, through dynamic light scattering assay, remain stable. Different concentrations of PEAL NPs co-incubated with zebrafish embryos at 6-72\u2009h post fertilization show that comparing with negative control, 10, 100, or 500\u2009\u03bcM of NPs for embryos development has no significant effects (p\u2009&gt;\u20090.05), only 1000 or 2000\u2009\u03bcM of NPs has some effects (p\u2009&lt;\u20090.05).

Method: Twenty-three inpatients with stage II, III or IV pressure ulcers in an acute care hospital were randomised to recieve (A) a HMB, arginine and glutamine mixture twice daily alongside oral nutritional supplements (n=11) or (B) standard nutritional care alongside oral nutritional supplements (n=12) for 2 weeks. Pressure ulcers were measured weekly for area, depth and Pressure Ulcer Scale for Healing (PUSH) scores. The proportion of viable tissue was determined based on area of wound tracing. Weekly laboratory tests were performed to measure C-reactive protein and pre-albumin levels. This trial is registered at http:\/\/ClinicalTrials.gov under NCT01090076. Results: There was no difference between anthropometrical measurements, biochemical parameters and nutritional intake pre- and post- study. Wound area did not decrease significantly in the short term for both groups. The proportion of viable tissues increased within 2 weeks on HMB, arginine and glutamine supplementation (p=0.02). PUSH scores showed significant improvement within 1 week of supplementation for the experimental group (p=0.013). Conclusion: The use of specialised amino acid does not appear to reduce wound size and PUSH scores but may improve tissue viability after 2 weeks. Further confirmation on a larger scale is required to determine the benefits of supplementing additional HMB, arginine and glutamine in patients with pressure ulcers.
