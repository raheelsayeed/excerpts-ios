While the white domed marble mausoleum is the most familiar component of the Taj Mahal, it is actually an integrated complex of structures. The construction began around 1632 and was completed around 1653, employing thousands of artisans and craftsmen. The construction of the Taj Mahal was entrusted to a board of architects under imperial supervision, including Abd ul-Karim Ma'mur Khan, Makramat Khan, and Ustad Ahmad Lahauri. Lahauri is generally considered to be the principal designer.</p>\n<p></p>","thumbnail":{"source":"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f5/Taj_Mahal_2012.jpg/500px-Taj_Mahal_2012.jpg","width":500,"height":288},"pageimage":"Taj_Mahal_2012.jpg"}}}}
