## Tag Selection

Tags are a great way to filter your notes. They're not for *finding* a note, but finding notes *belonging* to a topic or topics (tags):

Selecting a tag will immediately filter the notes, which you can see happening in the background. 

In RENOTE, you have three ways of filtering your notes:

1. **AND**: When you want to have all notes that are tagged with each of your selected tags. Each note that shows up in the filtered list **will** have the tags you selected.

2. **OR**:  Notes will have atleast one tag that you selected. 

3. **Untagged**: Exactly what it says, filtered notes do not have any associated tags.

Be aware of what option you have chosen.  At any point, you can clear all selections by tapping "Edit" and "Clear Tag Selections".
