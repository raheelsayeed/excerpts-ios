Sync And Backup
--------------

RENOTE utilizes Dropbox for device syncing and backup storage.

When you enable sync, that is after linking to a Dropbox account, all notes and tags are backed up and synced across to other iOS devices that run RENOTE which is linked with the same Dropbox account.

An important point to note here is that RENOTE data is **NOT** saved as text-files within Dropbox folder, we ***only use its backend***. But please remember, RENOTE was built around the idea of transferable data. So all your notes can be exported out into text-files (as a zip archive), which you can store anywhere and read using any text editor.

### Saving a Note as a text file to Dropbox or any other storage provider

- You will need to install Dropbox app on your iOS device (or any app that provides a system wide storage provider). That is configured with an account.
- While your viewing the note (not editing),  Pull-to-Activate the `Share` sheet or Tap "**⚪︎⚪︎⚪︎**" button on the left lower corner.
- In the second line of icons, Tap "**Save as file in...**".
- You should see a list of **storage providers** like iCloud, Google Drive, Dropbox. If you don't see your choice, Tap "More ..." and switch ON the Storage services available to you.
- Any storage provider (like Dropbox or Google Drive etc..) would require their own App installed on your device before they show up in the list.
